# Headless integration checks

`release-matrix.sh` is the executable release gate. `--source-only` runs the
complete Rust, every upstream-supported individual feature, package, and Nix
matrix. A release candidate must instead pass a
wtype-compatible input driver and a real Sway-compatible compositor, which adds
the layer-shell lifecycle and geometry acceptance below:

```sh
checks/release-matrix.sh wtype -- scroll -c '{config}'
```

The caller may set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; build orchestration should put it on a
filesystem with enough capacity rather than relying on a small temporary
filesystem.

The real-compositor gate builds the release binary, validates the upstream
minimal and desktop fixtures in every supported configuration format, renders
both built-in fixtures, and records startup-to-map latency, resident RSS, idle
CPU time, graph samples, and graph redraws in
`$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/cbar-performance-current.json`. Set `PERF_OUT` to choose a
different artifact path. Once a previous release record exists, pass it as
`PERF_BASELINE`; `compare-performance.py` then rejects material regressions
while allowing bounded scheduler and allocator noise. Records include a
fingerprint of the CPU, kernel, architecture, compositor argv, output, fixed
GTK/Cairo and compositor/pixman renderers, and sampling setup; mismatched
environments are not presented as comparable. The first release record is the
baseline, not a fabricated comparison target.
The gate also prints the complete small JSON record, so CI logs retain the
evidence even when no artifact publisher is configured.

`headless-session.sh` starts cbar inside a private, headless Wayland session. It proves two
layer-surface contracts that unit tests cannot observe:

- an internally dismissed resident launcher stays hidden after its next asynchronous preparation;
- the center container remains physically centred when start and end content have deliberately
  asymmetric widths.

The launcher assertion uses its opt-in progress trace plus the ordinary IPC status command. The
layout assertion uses `CBAR_LAYOUT_TRACE=1` to read GTK's final widget allocations, avoiding a
font- and theme-sensitive screenshot comparison. An opt-in graph trace counts sampler and Cairo
work during a six-second IPC-free idle window, long enough to include the five-second capability
cadence. None of these traces is active in an ordinary session.

The harness does not install or pin a compositor. Its input-driver argument must implement wtype's
named-key and sleep options (`-P`, `-p`, and `-s`). Pass an exact compositor argv after `--`; an
argument equal to `{config}` is replaced with the generated Sway-compatible fixture config:

```sh
checks/headless-session.sh target/debug/cbar wtype -- scroll -c '{config}'
```

All launcher inventory, configuration, mutable state, caches, IPC, D-Bus, and Wayland sockets live
under one private temporary directory. `HOME` and inherited compositor socket variables are removed
before startup, so the check cannot read personal configuration or target the caller's graphical
session. The compositor, cbar, and virtual-keyboard drivers each run in an owned session group;
cleanup sends the whole group bounded `TERM` then `KILL`, including in-group wrapper descendants.

The `mpris` CI selector runs the actual music polling workers on an isolated
D-Bus session with no player. It verifies that repeated bus-name churn leaves no
idle subscriber behind. The test is ignored by ordinary `cargo test` so it never
connects to a developer's desktop bus; run it through the declared selector.
